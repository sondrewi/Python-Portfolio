# Python Portfolio
My Python portfolio: 
Part 1 (A1.py & A2.py):Two Python projects for the class "Computing and Numerics" taken spring 2021.
Each project was written with Jupyter Notebooks and includes the respective questions/tasks given.
Project 1 (A1) was focused on fundamentals of numerical computing and numerical integration and differentiation.
Project 2 (A2) was focused on finding roots to polynomials in the real and complex planes as well as working with numerical approaches to systems of ODEs.
I consider these projects the most informative and fun assignments I have had at university.

Part 2 (Assembler.py & VMTranslator.py): Independent projects. As part of reading and doing the exercises for the book "The Elements of Computing Systems", I have written an assembler and a virtual machine translator in Python for a simple, 16-bit computer from scratch (the book and associated project is also often known as "Nand2Tetris"). The book included specifications for a simple assembly language and hardware specification language with which I also implemented a fully functioning CPU. The CPU and all its parts, all of which the reader has to manually implement, could be tested on a hardware simulator included with the book. I have included the VM translator and assembler here. This code is not well commented as it was part of a project done entirely for fun.

Part 3 (Integral Calc.py): An integral calculator that animates a function being integrated over a given domain built in Python.

Part 4 (pipesim1.py): CODE for Vacation Scholarship Project 2022. This piece of code synthesises the sound made by an organ pipe of specific dimensions and shape. Within the code, these can be changed at the behest of the user. A pressure profile at the opening of the virtual pipe is also produced and plotted. For more information, please the full document "Organ Pipe Sound Synthesis with Finite Difference Schemes".
