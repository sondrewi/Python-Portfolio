# Python Portfolio (All files can be viewed directly in GitHub with no download)

Part 1 ("Vacation Scholarship: Project Report" & "pipesim1.py"): This is the culmination of work I did as part of a vacation scholarship awarded by the School of Mathematics, Edinburgh University, in summer 2022. Under guidance of Dr. Charlotte Desvages, I investigated finite difference schemes for sound synthesis of organ pipes using Python. The report sets forth the aims of the project, derives a physical model of an organ pipe, and describes associated energy equations when finite difference schemes are used to analyse the varying air pressure within. The python file "pipesim1.py" computationally implements the model for an organ pipe of specific dimensions and shape. Within the code, these can be changed at the behest of the user. An animation of the pressure profile within the pipe against time is also produced. For more information, please see the full report.

Part 2 ("Numerical Linear Algebra Project"): Project completed as part of coursework for the class "Numerical Linear Algebra" that I completed fall 2022. The assignment was submitted as a Jupyter notebook and assessed students' understanding of several numerical algorithms for the solution of systems of equations. The assignment contained tasks pertaining to both coding and conceptual knowledge. Awarded Grade: 94/100.

Part 3 ("A1.ipynb" & "A2.ipynb"):Two Python projects for the class "Computing and Numerics" taken spring 2021.
Each project was written with Jupyter Notebooks and includes the respective questions/tasks given.
Project 1 (A1) was focused on fundamentals of numerical computing and numerical integration and differentiation.
Project 2 (A2) was focused on finding roots to polynomials in the real and complex planes as well as working with numerical approaches to systems of ODEs.
Grade Awarded A1: 34/35. Grade Awarded A2: 38.5/40.

Part 4 (Assembler.py & VMTranslator.py): Independent projects. As part of reading and doing the exercises for the book "The Elements of Computing Systems", I have written an assembler and a virtual machine translator in Python for a simple, 16-bit computer from scratch (the book and associated project is also often known as "Nand2Tetris"). The book included specifications for a simple assembly language and hardware specification language with which I also implemented a fully functioning CPU. The CPU and all its parts, all of which the reader has to manually implement, could be tested on a hardware simulator included with the book. I have included the VM translator and assembler here. This code is not well commented as it was part of a project done entirely for fun in summer 2021.

Part 5 (Integral Calc.py): An integral calculator that animates a function being integrated over a given domain built in Python. I did this small project for fun in spring 2021.
