# Computing-and-Numerics-Projects
Two Python projects for the class "Computing and Numerics" taken spring 2021.
Each project was written with Jupyter Notebooks and includes the respective questions/tasks given.
Project 1 (A1) was focused on fundamentals of numerical computing and numerical integration and differentiation.
Project 2 (A2) was focused on finding roots to polynomials in the real and complex planes as well as working with numerical approaches to systems of ODEs.
I consider these projects the most informative and fun assignments I have had at university, as I was able to use so much of the mathematics learned in
other mathematics courses when working with numerical methods.
