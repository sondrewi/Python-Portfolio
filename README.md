# Python Portfolio
My Python portfolio: 
Part 1:Two Python projects for the class "Computing and Numerics" taken spring 2021.
Each project was written with Jupyter Notebooks and includes the respective questions/tasks given.
Project 1 (A1) was focused on fundamentals of numerical computing and numerical integration and differentiation.
Project 2 (A2) was focused on finding roots to polynomials in the real and complex planes as well as working with numerical approaches to systems of ODEs.
I consider these projects the most informative and fun assignments I have had at university, as I was able to use so much of the mathematics learned in
other mathematics courses when working with numerical methods.

Part 2: Independent projects. As part of reading and doing the exercises for the book "The Elements of Computing Systems", I have written an assembler and a virtual machine translator in Python for a simple, 8-bit computer from scratch (the book and associated project is also often known as "Nand2Tetris"). The book included specifications for a simple assembly language and hardware specification language with which I also implemented a fully functioning CPU. The CPU and all its parts, all of which the reader has to manually implement, could be tested on a hardware simulator included with the book. I have included the VM translator and assembler here. This code is not well commented as it was part of a project done entirely for fun.
